Welcome to Coyote's documentation!
====================================

**An operating system for FPGAs**
------------------------------------

**Coyote** is a framework that offers operating system abstractions and a variety of shared networking (*RDMA*, *TCP/IP*), memory (*DRAM*, *HBM*)
and accelerator (*GPU*) services for modern heterogeneous platforms with *FPGAs*, targeting data centers and cloud environments. 
Coyote's objective is to facilitate easy and quick deployment of custom applications on modern reconfigurable hardaware, in a distributed and heterogeneous fashion.
