UNIT_TEST_DIR in CMAKE

.env script for intellisense
(due to runtime configuration)

Either use the following methods/structure.


THis does XYZ



OR directly access the streamIO writer for more flexibilty.

However, you have to pay close attention to the method descriptions, and which methods are blocking!

Add requirements!!

Compiling the whole project can be slow. Try testing modules independently during Developement to speed-up the process!

Explain decision on when to re-compile!
