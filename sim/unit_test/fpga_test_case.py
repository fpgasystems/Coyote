        Blocking call that does the following:

        - Starts a FPGA simulation
        - Waits for all LOCAL_WRITES to complete that have been triggered via the 'set_expected_output' calls.
          If no output has been specified, no local transfer checks will be performed.
        - Asserts all input to be done
        - Waits for the simulation to terminate itself.

        If you need more control over how the simulation is run, you can use the simulate_fpga_non_blocking
        and finish_fpga_simulation calls, which run the simulation in a separate thread and dont perform
        any io calls. However, please make sure to mark the input as done as soon as no more io calls will
        be performed. Otherwise, the simulation will hang!
